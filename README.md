# Capstone-sp24-14 -- Autonomous Mapping of Water and Fertilizer Content in Soil

Our project aims to solve the waste of water and nitrogen (fertilizer) during the agricultural process, and to prevent the problems that arise from that waste. In order to address this, our group will build a robot with data collection tools to sample and map soil properties over a field. The robot will operate autonomously (with obstacle avoidance) on the ground and use sensors and vision to determine soil contents. From there, prescription maps will be generated to advise users of ideal soil treatment.
